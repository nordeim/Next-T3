Here‚Äôs a careful breakdown of what your runtime log is telling us:

---

## üîç Step‚Äëby‚Äëstep review

### 1. `npm install`
- **Prisma postinstall hook ran successfully**:
  - Environment variables were loaded from `.env`.
  - Prisma schema was found at `prisma/schema.prisma`.
  - Prisma Client v6.17.1 was generated into `node_modules/@prisma/client`.
- **Dependencies**:
  - 446 packages installed and audited.
  - No vulnerabilities reported.
- ‚úÖ This confirms your dependency tree is healthy and Prisma is ready to be imported anywhere in your app.

---

### 2. `npm run build` ‚Üí `next build`
- **Next.js version**: 15.5.6.
- **Environment detection**: Both `.env.local` and `.env` were loaded.
- **Build process**:
  - Compilation succeeded in ~11.4s.
  - TypeScript and ESLint checks passed.
  - Page data collected.
  - 4 static pages generated.
  - Build traces collected (used for deployment analysis).
  - Page optimization finalized.
- **Retrying 1/3‚Ä¶**:
  - This is a normal internal retry mechanism in Next.js build pipeline (e.g., when fetching or compiling certain modules). Since it succeeded, no action is needed.
- **Route summary**:
  - `/` ‚Üí dynamic server‚Äërendered route (∆í).
  - `/_not-found` ‚Üí static prerendered page (‚óã).
  - `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` ‚Üí dynamic API route.
  - `/api/trpc/[trpc]` ‚Üí dynamic API route.
- **Bundle size**:
  - Shared JS: ~102 kB (reasonable for a T3 starter).
  - Individual chunks: ~45‚Äì55 kB each.
- ‚úÖ This indicates a clean, optimized production build.

---

### 3. `bun next start`
- **Startup**:
  - Production server booted in ~0.5s.
  - Available locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
  - Available on container network at `http://172.20.0.6:3000`.
- **Runtime activity**:
  - `[TRPC] post.hello took 1ms to execute` ‚Üí confirms your tRPC router is wired up and responding instantly.
- ‚úÖ This shows the production server is running correctly and serving both pages and API routes.

---

## üßæ Overall assessment
- **Dependencies**: Installed cleanly, Prisma Client generated.
- **Build**: Successful, optimized, no type or lint errors.
- **Server**: Started quickly, responding to tRPC calls.
- **Bundle sizes**: Normal for a fresh T3 app.
- **No errors**: The retry during build was transient and resolved automatically.

---

## ‚úÖ Next steps / validation checklist
- Test your shadcn/ui components in both dev (`bun next dev`) and prod (`bun next build && bun next start`) to ensure styles and tokens apply correctly.
- Confirm environment‚Äësensitive features (NextAuth, Prisma DB connection) work in production mode.
- If deploying beyond Docker, ensure `.next/` is included in your build artifact and `bun next start` is the entrypoint.

---

‚ú® In short: your app is in excellent shape ‚Äî dependencies are healthy, the build pipeline is clean, and the production server is running smoothly with tRPC responding in milliseconds. This is exactly the baseline you want before layering in more UI components or deploying to staging.
